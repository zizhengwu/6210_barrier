Dear Colleague,

As you may already know, I am overseeing the development of a new
parallel programming library for shared memory machines called gtmp.
I asked one of my developers to implement several barrier
synchronization and run some experiments to help us decide which to
adopt.  The results were a little surprising to me, and I was hoping
that I could get your to share your thoughts on them.

In summary, we compared the algorithms presented in the famous
Mellor-Crummey Scott paper by measuring how long it took for a given
number of threads to cross 10^6 barriers. All experiments were run on
a dedicated machine with 24 cores total. Details on the machine are
attached along with the data from the experiments.

Looking forward to your insight!
